# Contributing

The page describes how we work with this repository.

## General principles

- Please don't push changes to the master directly. Allow your changes to be peer reviewed.
- Please use `dev` branch for things that may break existing features.
- Please use `stable` branch for production deployments.
- Tag versions so that we can use specific versions. _We need to come up with strategy for this._
